# CsEdit

CsEdit is a C# programmer's editor tool, in early stage of development, based on RoslynPad(https://github.com/roslynpad/roslynpad).

Objectives of CsEdit:

* To support a hierarchy of multiple projects, containing multiple source files (TODO, currently some fixed demo/test projects are used).
* To support Linux, Mono, and multiple (also earlier) C# language versions.

CsEditor features:
* All RoslynPad editor features.
* Go To Defintion (an initial implementation exists).
